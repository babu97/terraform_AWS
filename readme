# we are going to implement this architecture using  this tools
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) -check the Terraform documentation 
- [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - we will use Ansible for configuration Management 
- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) - we will use Packer to build the AMI  images 

# Not included in this scope but nice to have 

-  HashiCorp Vault 


kindly never use this in production its for learning purposes. All the terraform  modules are custom 
made and not tested, I recommend using open source modules  at  https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules for Production 


Also note implementing this project is costly and is not covered by free tier. Its best to implement this 
project continously  without stopping.

1. Git clone this repository 

2. Make sure you set ans AWS CLI on your Host  - check from the documentation  -https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

3. Login to you to AWS console and go to IAM and generate AWS  access Keys  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html


4. Initiate `aws configure ` from  the terminal  and you will be prompted to put ACCESS ID and ACCESS KEY and default region - watch this 
youtube tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7MgJYlJd7M&ab_channel=KeidrickPettaway 

5. Try implement the project manually first by  referring to the diagram above it will really come in Handy before automating 
it with terraform 

## Packer Images 
Kindly note we have to build the images we are using for this Project be sure to check 
this repository to check the packer code for buidling all the images we require for this
Project.

Learn about Packer Images Here - https://www.packer.io/



https://github.com/babu97/AMI.git

Replace all the Ami  accordingly on the terraform code 
if we are  are using Ubuntu AMI be sure  copy and replace 

## Setup your Domain 

Ensure you have create a hosted Zone in AWS Route 53 Before spinning running the terraform 
code. 
get free domain at -freenom 

watch this tutorial to know how  - https://dev.to/omarcloud20/how-to-create-a-free-custom-domain-name-for-your-lambda-url-a-step-by-step-tutorial-47jl



## Terraform 
 
 1. Setup Terraform in your system watch this tutorial -  https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli

 2. Ensure you already know terraform basics before proceeding , you can learn terraform from youtube tutorials or 
 Udemy videos.

3. setup Terraform cloud as we are going to  run this project from the terraform console  - https://app.terraform.io/

4. Create  a  terraform workspace  

5. Ensure you have Pushed your project to GitHub  - watch this tutorial to learn how to setup 
terraform cloud  wordspace - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3PlM4erixY&t=287s&ab_channel=NedintheCloud

6.Import your repository to your cloud 

7. Setup Terraform Variables ensure you have defined your AWS  access ID and Key in Enviromental variables 

8. if everything is succesful you should be seeing something like this

9. Iniate Terraform apply from the cloud  be sure to check the resources that will be created  and give
and approval. 


## Ansible 

check this Repository  for the Ansible code  we are going to use  in this 
project  -https://github.com/babu97/ansible-prj19.git


Kindly note we are using Ansible  dynamic  ec2 host to  get all the ip address
of servers that we want to configure.
Ensure to  SSH into the Bation Host  and run this Ansible Script. 
It will automate  all the deployments  if Eveything is succesful it

should setup Everything.
